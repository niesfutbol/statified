    The tilt tells us about the possession of a team's ball in an area where it can do damage, the last third of the pitch.
    The definition of tilt is the percentage of total passes that a team made in the final third of the field.
    For example, suppose that there were ten passes in the last third of the pitch in a game.
    Let's say the home team made seven passes, and the away team made 3.
    So the home team's tilt would be 70%, and the away team's 30%.

    The PPDA is a metric that we use to evaluate the defensive pressure of a team on the opposing
    team. The PPDA measures the number of passes the defending team allows before it takes defensive
    action. These defensive actions can be a steal attempt, an interception, or a foul.

    BDP (Build-Up Disruption) is a metric to measure a team's ability to disrupt the opposing team's
    build-up game. The name refers to the interruption in the construction phase of the play.
